# web3-learning-notes

short notes and explanations collected while learning web3, the evm and basic on-chain mechanics.

## sections

- `evm-basics.md` → what the evm is and how it executes code
- `gas-explained.md` → how gas works and why it matters
- `wallet-security.md` → simple rules to not get wrecked

this repo is mostly for myself, but might be useful for anyone new to on-chain.
