# wallet security

some simple rules so you don't lose funds.

## basics

- never share your seed phrase. no legit team will ever ask.
- use hardware wallets for bigger amounts.
- separate "hot" and "cold" wallets.

## on-chain habits

- double-check contract addresses, not just names.
- test with small amounts first.
- revoke approvals you no longer need.

web3 is powerful, but the user is the final line of defense.
